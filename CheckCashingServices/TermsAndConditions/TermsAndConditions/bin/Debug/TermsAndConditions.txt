harmless from any and all demands, liabilities, losses, costs and claims, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, (collectively "Liabilities") asserted against Isotope11, its contracted providers, agents, Clients,

agreed to the performance of any product sold by Client, its agents, employees or assigns. Client agrees to

subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees) from any and all
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees
and all related costs and expenses) incurred by Client as a result of any claim, judgment, or adjudication
against Client arising from a claim that Client's use of the Isotope11 Content, as permitted under this
Agreement, infringes Intellectual Property rights of a third party or arising from a claim which results
from Isotope 11’s breach of the warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. To qualify for
such defense and payment, Client must: (i) give Isotope11 prompt written notice of a claim; and (ii) allow
Isotope11 to control, and fully cooperate with Isotope11 in, the defense and all related negotiations.

party products, including hardware and software, (v) modifications or maintenance of the Product by a
party other than Isotope11, (vi) misuse of the Product, and (vii) failure of Client to implement any
improvement or updates to the Product, if the infringement claim would have been avoided by the use of
the improvement or updates.
9.3. Promptly after receipt by a person entitled to indemnification pursuant to the foregoing Section 9.1 or 9.2
(the "Indemnified Party") of notice of the commencement of any action, the Indemnified Party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be or has been made against a party who has agreed to provide
indemnification under Section 9.1 or 9.2 (an "Indemnifying Party"), promptly notify in writing the
Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to the Indemnified Party except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by the delay or failure to notify it. In case any such action is brought
against an Indemnified Party, and it notifies the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in, and, to the extent that it may wish, jointly with any
other Indemnifying Party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, subject to the provisions
herein stated, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and after notice from the

Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section 9 for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the
action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the fees and expenses
of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (i) the employment of such counsel
has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to any such
action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified Party or parties and the
Indemnifying Party and, in the judgement of counsel for the Indemnified Party, it is advisable for the
Indemnified Party or parties to be represented by separate counsel (in which case the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf of the Indemnified Party or parties,
it being understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such
action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the
same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm of attorneys for the Indemnified Party or parties. No settlement of any action against an
Indemnified Part shall be made without the consent of the Indemnifying Party and no Indemnifying Party,
in the defense of any such claim or action, shall, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, consent
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in
respect to such claim or litigation. If the Indemnified Party fails to execute a release or other settlement
agreement under circumstances where all of the conditions of the preceding sentence have been met, the
Indemnifying Party shall have no further obligation to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise.
